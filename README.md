## Motivation

The aim of this project is to try out different techniques to learn by examples. For example, the usages of modern template engines like Tymeleaf to display **HTML** correctly in browsers. Especially in combination with **ZeroMQ** by coding ZeroMQ-scripts in Python to deliver simple message queues. ZeroMQ-scripts still need to be implemented to subscribe. Dummy objects are provided in the meantime.
